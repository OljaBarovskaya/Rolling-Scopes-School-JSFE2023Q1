  It's a copy of a classic minesweeper. The goal of this game is try to find all the mines that are hidden in the field by opening the cells and marking the expected mines with red flag. The numbers in the cells show the amount of mines that are located around the cell. The game ends either when the user opens all the safe cells (he wins the game) or when he presses the cell with the mine (he loses the game).
The main options of an app are:
  - It has three levels of complecity.
  - The user can point the number of mines himself.
  - The are also options to change a theme (dark/light) and enable/disable a sound.
  - The cell is opened with the left-click
  - The cell is pointed with red flag with the right click
  - To restart the game, please press <img width="25" height="25" alt="emoji" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95ed62ec-df2d-4722-99df-fc6bcf0bff35" />
